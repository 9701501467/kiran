# AEM Guides - WKND SPA Project

This is the code companion for a series of tutorials designed for developers new to the **SPA Editor** feature in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). There are two parallel versions of the tutorial:

* [Create your first React SPA in AEM](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-learn/tutorials/develop-spa-react/overview.html)
* [Create your first Angular SPA in AEM](https://docs-stg.corp.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-learn/tutorials/develop-spa-angular/overview.html)

The starter and solution branches in this repository correspond to **React** and **Angular** versions of the tutorial.
